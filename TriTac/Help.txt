TriTac.bmx Is a version of the Tri Tactics game using Basenet (bsnv3doPc.bmx) I've tested this on XP, Vista and W10
over an internet connected network. If you want to play this over the internet please check that you have
port forwarding enabled on the port the game uses. NB I have not tweeked this for a Mac yet.
The file is in zip form (compressed) as there are graphic and data files that are needed to play the game.
Just unzip to a folder of your choice.
