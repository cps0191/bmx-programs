TriTac.bmx Is a version of the Tri Tactics game using Basenet (bsnv3doPc.bmx) I've tested this on XP, Vista and W10
This is intended for two players/computers conected via a LAN or the INTERNET. They both need an internet conection
as this uses the GNET lobby to advertise the session. If you want to play this over the internet please check that
you have port forwarding enabled on the port the game uses.
NB1 The folders with the data/graphics must be in the same folder as the application.
NB2 I have not tweeked this for a Mac yet.
