BNetv2d0Pc.BMX is a GUI implimentation of the GNET networking system tested on  Vista and XP only.
Version 2 differs from version 1 as it includes feedback so that a game message sent is confirmed
and if not recived repeated, hopefully this will get round any drop out in the coms cycle.
This is intended as a framework for internet/networked games and uses the GNET lobby to 
advertise the game you are hosting, hence you will need an internet conection to use this program. 
It includes a basic one line chat routine and a player group you can add prefered players to.
